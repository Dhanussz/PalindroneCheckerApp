# PalindroneCheckerApp
# PalindromeCheckerApp

## Objective

To develop a Java application that checks whether a given input is a palindrome and to demonstrate Git branching, committing, pushing, and merging using multiple use cases.

## Project Procedure

1. Created a GitHub repository named PalindromeCheckerApp with README file.
2. Cloned the repository to local system using git clone command.
3. Opened the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
4. Created a module named App and added the Java class PalindromeCheckerApp.java.
5. Created separate branches for each use case.
6. Implemented palindrome checking logic in the Java file.
7. Added files using git add and verified using git status.
8. Committed changes and pushed branches to GitHub.
9. Created Pull Requests and merged branches into main.
    
## Project Flow
Repository creation → Clone → IntelliJ setup → Branch creation → Code implementation → Add → Commit → Push → Pull Request → Merge → Update main.
